# Stroll the Dice

This is a game made for submission to [GMTK Game Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022), with the theme "Roll of the Dice". You can [play it here](https://oegly.itch.io/stroll-the-dice)

Try to navigate through the maze and reach the goal while avoiding monsters. Each time you are attacked, you roll a six-sided dice to protect yourself. When the dice protects you, the side it lands on will be corrupted. If the dice later lands on a corrupted side, you will not be protected. As the dice becomes increasingly corrupted, each new attack carries more risk of defeat.

The monsters are stunned for a brief moment after you roll your dice. They can also be distracted by torches, which make them unable to both move and attack. Torches can be picked up and moved.

Use WASD to move, spacebar to pick up and place torches.
